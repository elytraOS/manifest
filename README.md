*Let your Android experience fly.*

## Getting started
First of all, you should have a decent knowledge about the [Source Control Tools](https://source.android.com/setup/develop).

After you got all the needed commands for setting up your environment, set up the sources.

    repo init -u https://github.com/elytraOS/manifest.git -b scorch

And then start syncing with our sources.

    repo sync -c -j$(nproc --all) --force-sync --no-clone-bundle --no-tags --current-branch

And now, you are ready to start building. Remember to set up device tree, common tree (if any) *etc*.

There are many way you can start to modify your device/common tree for building **elytraOS**. You can check our devices trees, if you have any problems. All of them (***should***) boot, and it's a great way of adapting your device tree to elytraOS.

## Building
Now that you (presumably) got everything working, you can finally start building elytraOS.

    . build/envsetup.sh
    lunch elytra_<codename>-userdebug
    brunch <codename>

#### Example
    . build/envsetup.sh
    lunch elytra_vayu-userdebug
    brunch vayu
